## *ðŸ”¥ OOPCG-Mini-Projects ðŸŽ´*

Welcome to our collection of "Object Oriented Programming and Computer Graphics" projects developed during our college course! This repository contains a "Library Management System" and a "Tower Of Hanoi Game" created using C++. These projects were developed as part of our learning journey, and we hope you find them entertaining and educational. ðŸš€

3. Now just download the files and run the codes in the "Terminal" with these commands:

```
g++ LMS.cpp -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
```

```
.\a.exe
```

```
g++ TOH.cpp -lbgi -lgdi32 -lcomdlg32 -luuid -loleaut32 -lole32
```

```
.\a.exe
```
